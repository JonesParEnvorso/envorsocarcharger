Q1: What are the most frustrating parts about locating a car charger? (Finding the right speed, finding the right price, finding a charger you have an account with, etc.)

- I haven't had any issues finding charging stations. The app PlugShare is very helpful.
- Finding a charger at all, that is available, and working.
- Location, speed
- Finding one with the right speed
- Locations would be nicer if they were placed at or close to shops
- Finding one that's close enough

Q2: Are there any features that you would look for in an app that deals with locating electric car chargers (or any other charging apps that currently exist that you use)?

- An option to list nearby amenities by category.. Restaurants, geocery, etc.. All of which are walking distance oriented... As well, perhaps the ability to reverse-search 
for a charging station near (within walking distance) a particular type of amenity.
- Electrify America is great, but runs into issues with payments
- Current apps work well
- What’s nearby—restaurants, stores, etc
- Trip planner from charger to charger
- Maybe a feature to say where a good location for a charger. Or whats a good speed
- Estimates how far you can go till the next one accurately

Q3: Any other comments?

- They need to start putting charging stations near laundromats. Seems logical to do so.
- If you have any questions, my husband was working on a start up with these direct issues and even submitted them to YCombinator. 
If you’d like to reach out to know about his research and ideas let us know.
