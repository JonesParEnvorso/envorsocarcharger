Meeting with Bob

Talked about what we will do at the ford dealer.

***************
Lucas Keizur:
Brain Dump.
Charging:
The process of charging a car is convoluted and tedius.
For most any charge, the user must go through multiple companies' software.
Current solutions are unefficient and impractical. They only do half the job and not the good half.
There is no consistency amongst charging companies and even within a single charging company, the process is excessive.
Mustang:
Excelent car, most physical characteristics are designed practically.
The draw back is the software. The GUI seems not quite tested enough.
some common information like charging rate/progress aren't in the area one would expect.
Other bits of information just arn't obvoius or even existent. It is hard to tell when the car is or isn't charging.
The GUI is full of information. This might be great from an enthusiest's point of view, but the typical consumer
may find this overwelming. Despite the desnity of the interface, it still takes 3 taps of the interface to see 
the charge on the center console, and thats if you know what buttons to actually press.
Overall, the car is great, the GUI just needs better usability for a more typical consumer.

Thank you Bob for the ride and coffee, we all learned a lot.
