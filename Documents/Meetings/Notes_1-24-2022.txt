Questions:

What are you looking high, low design?

High level, how this problem as its own as a software should be seperated into logica parts.
Everything related to database, everything related to backend, everything related to user.
Low level design, how inout is handle, output handled, data structures used, what primitives, functianality of moduals.
Function signitures.
Have ideas on our own, doesn't have to be permanent or practical.
